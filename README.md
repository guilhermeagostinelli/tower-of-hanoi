# Tower of Hanoi

Implementation of the famous puzzle "Tower of Hanoi" using C# / Windows Forms Application.

There's also a .vdproj file in the codebase used for creating an installer (.exe and .msi files).

## History and How to Play

The puzzle's main goal is to move disks from the leftmost peg onto the rightmost peg.
However, bigger disks cannot be put on the top of smaller ones and only one disk may be moved at a time.

The original Tower of Hanoi was invented in 1883 by the french mathematician Ã‰douard Anatole Lucas, who was inspired by the Hindu myth which said that, after the priests completed the tiring task of finishing a tower of 64 disks, the world would vanish and everything would be turned into dust.
